    \section*{Profile}\small
    \vspace{-5pt}

        I am a dedicated worker able to work well individually or as part of a
        team. I have a good grounding in Ruby, Python, Java, C\#, C and C++ with a little
        experience in \LaTeX\, \& Erlang and can pick up new computer languages
        quickly. I have built 6+ computers for myself and others; in building
        these computers I personally selected compatible parts, connected it all
        together and installed appropriate operating systems, drivers and
        software. I have had experience in setting up network, RAID/LVM’s and
        virtualising machines under both Windows and Linux.

        \subsection*{Strengths}
        \begin{packed_items}\small
            \item{High level of technical skills relating to the IT industry.}
            \item{Quick learner, especially for any computer related activities.}
